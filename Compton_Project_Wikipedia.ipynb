How he broke the Sinn Féin constitution, created fake cumainn to give him fake votes and barred life long republicans from voting.  How he managed to expel himself and his supporters from Sinn Féin membership.  And, how a small band of republicans managed to keep the Sinn Féin constitution and traditional policy in tact. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1986 Section 1b. of the Sinn Féin constitution read as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n“No person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 26-County or 6-County  parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership.\"\" \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Adams leadership put forward a motion, titled Resolution 162, at the 1986 Ard Fheis.  Its wording was as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\nRESOLUTION 162\\r\\n\\r\\nTHAT this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections:\\r\\n\\r\\na. Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle.\\r\\n\\r\\nb. Shall not draw their salaries for personal use. (Parliamentary representatives shall be paid a Sinn Fein organiser’s subsidy, and the Leinster House salary shall be divided at the direction of the Ard Chomhairle to defray national and constituency expenses.)\\r\\n\\r\\nTo accommodate this change, the Constitution and Rules be amended as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nThat Section 1b of the Constitution be amended to read:\\r\\n \\r\\nNo person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 6-County parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership. \\r\\n\\r\\nMotion 162 supports and approves of the candidature of persons who, if  elected, would be of the intention to take their seats in certain circumstances i.e. on the direction of the Ard Chomhairle.  Obviously, Motion 162 infringes Section 1b.  Section 1b. was in effect at the time this Resolution was presented.  Its clear that Adams made a mistake in procedure.  He should have sought a majority decision to amend Section 1b. in 1986 and returned in 1987 to propose entering Leinster House.  Trying to amend Section 1b. and propose taking seats in the “partitionist 26-County Parliament” in the same Resolution was a logical impossibility. \\r\\n\\r\\nCan anybody say that  the wording:\\r\\n\\r\\n“That this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections:\\r\\n\\r\\na.  Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle”\\r\\n\\r\\ndoes not constitute the supporting and approving of the candidature of persons who intend to take their seats in Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle?\\r\\nClearly Adams was in breach of Section 1b. and according to that section he had expelled himself, and all those who voted for Resolution 162.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrian Feeney, in his book, Sinn Féin 100 Turbulent Years, puts forward the argument that Adams had managed to bypass Section 1b, by introducing a motion in 1983 allowing the “discussion” of any aspect of the Sinn Féin constitution.  This change may indeed have facilitated debate on abstentionism but it did not infringe on the content or effect of Section 1b in any way.  To discuss something is not the same as formally proposing or supporting it.  For example, conventions are held regularly where drug addiction is discussed without any of the delegates proposing or supporting it.  In fact the line Adams added in 1983 was superfluous, as the Sinn Féin constitution had never banned the “discussion” of anything – just the “approving” and “supporting” of taking seats in named partitionist parliaments.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course its not illegal to amend or remove section 1b. Section 1b. bans the approval or support of candidates who intend to take seats in British assemblies. It can be removed or amended at any Ard Fheis by a two thirds majority. The reason for doing so could be many. Perhaps delegates might feel that it implies that they cannot be trusted to be loyal to the Republic. In fact its not necess',\n",

We know about when the generator went off line and we know when they landed. The rest is deduction. What I cannot tell you is if they were down on an island on their belly, (see Lambrechts opinion of landing chances on Gardener) how long they could operate their radios. Or if their electrical system would have been intact enough to function. I grew up in the age of the vacuum tube and know that it would take a minute or two - to \\'warm\\' up the dynamotor and transmitter to the point where it would achieve full power. This is all assuming they had no serious damage to the airplane. My \\'best guess\"\" (OPINION, don\\'t ask me to put it in the article) is that they probably had at least one hour of operation. The other question is how much \"\"gain\"\" they would have gotten from a \"\"less than optimum\"\" (to quote the TIGHAR radio guy) length under 1/8 wave, V-type antenna sitting less than six feet off the ground. The answer is probably - but not definitely - not much. We are looking at an actual output from the antenna of perhaps 10-20 watts with a horizontal polarity and bad angle. Perhaps they were heard. Odds are they were not. (I repeat this is OPINION). Still we need to consider these things. My guess is that Earhart (OPINION) could have transmitted and received for at least 1 hour. That she could have done one or the other longer. One must remember that a dynamotor was a pretty inefficient means of turning low DC voltage into high voltage AC for radio communications, thus the receiver alone would have more operational life than the transmitter (once again, we do not know how many minutes the xmitter or receiver were on during the Hawaii flight, but a good guess is that they both ran all the time). That the propagation characteristics of her antenna and the frequencies she was able to operate on severely limited any possible range.

No control for mass was done in either experiment, and evaporation of order of less than microgram per second could easily explain the effect (especially in the NASA case); even more so, if there is some moisture. What you are essentially doing, is microwaving the interior of a cone, and - surprise surprise - there is a small force in the opposite direction. Then you turn off the heating, but your interior is still at higher temperature, measure it again, and there is still a force - yet smaller. Nothing to do with exotic physics, everything to do with experimental error due to unforeseen effect of evaporation, i.e. ablation (though some moisture might play an effect, especially if there are parts other than metal; this is, in my opinion, the most likely explanation - EM radiation cannot cause such effect at these power/force ratios (that part was also removed from the article, though all was sourced). So, if there is no some weird effect (and QED effects, virtual plasma included, boil down to EM radiation reaction, there is no violation of impulse conservation there, so that is excluded too), it should be reaction from some loss of mass - and evaporation is an obvious source. However, they did not check for that. Also, some of experiments were done in atmosphere (at atmospheric pressure, even in chamber?! according to brief paper), so other possibility is interaction with heated air. However, in vacuum, ablation seems to be most likely explanation. Why all this sourced material and all criticism was removed, beats me. 213.198.221.171',\n",

Using your reasoning, we should never be able to oppose on comprehensiveness issues either, because if a consensus of the regular editors of the page says that the article is comprehensive, then it must be. FAC's entire purpose is to try to get a larger perspective on whether the article meets the appropriate policies or guidelines (in other words, consensus can change). I do think that the RCC page suffers sometimes because most of its editors have a very strong POV. That is understandable; people usually work on topics they are passionate about (either for or against). I fully acknowledge (and praise) that they are trying to make the article as NPOV as possible, but when you hold a strong POV sometimes it is hard to recognize where neutral actually is. That is why processes like FAC, GAN, and PR are essential, because then you can get (hopefully) the opinions of people who don't hold a strong POV on the topic. I would encourage you to post at WT:FAC to see what the consensus is for how to review an article - are NPOV and comprehensiveness concerns off-limits?  Or perhaps it would be useful to post at WT:NPOV to see whether there is consensus for your view that NPOV is decided solely by consensus.

He posted this article either because he is hateful person and cares little for facts, or is a Serb Nationalist who hates Croats and tries to spread lies about something that did not take place. Spegalj did plot to undermine Serb control over Yugoslavia and has ploted to overthrow Yugoslav military in Croatia and Slovenia, but quoted article is pure hate speech and propaganda, I might add in EU hate internet speech is a criminal offense. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would appreciate if you lock the article, remove the quoted material and ban user Miquonranger03, his actions on this particular article are considered pure hate speech and Nationalist Serb propaganda. If you allow Serbs and others to ruin Wiki\\'s reputation and allow characters like Miquonranger03 to edit and post lies and hate on wiki, Wiki will open itself to all kinds of problems, legal and all kinds, EU laws are quite clear about hate speech, I am sure you also disapprove of hateful propaganda on wiki. Please act now and ban  Miquonranger03 and remove offending material, only when transcripts of this document are available should this be posted, with highlighted parts of the transcripts, nothing less would do, btw plz read the quteded article, it is all made up lies and hate speech by Miquonranger03. \\r\\n\\r\\nthank you. \\r\\n\\r\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Miquonranger03\\r\\n\\r\\n    * As for border posts, when border posts are disarmed, then they will be disarmed, all of them, as many as there are, but leave Albanians five bullets in their automatic rifles, and the rest locked up in cellars and given food and water if this goes on for a few days.

       " '\"\\r\\n\\r\\n What is Linga? \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the Linga? And what is the meaning of the symbol? There are few ways to explain the meaning and the symbol of Linga.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Linga as Arthabrahma or phenomenal manifestation\\r\\n\\r\\nLinga is the amorphous representation of Shiv and can be regarded as the highest emblem of Shiv because of its least anthrophomorphic nature. Shiv, Parabrahman, is the highest Divine Principle in intimate union with Divine Power, the Parashakti. The only positive qualities of this Divine Principle are Shat, Chit, and Anand. He is conscious of Himself i.e. He has Atmavimarsha. He is the cosmic Purusha (person) but is Nirakar - has no particular form and has no distinguishing mark. He is therefore inconceivable. \"\"God cannot be known by the mind or the physical senses\"\" is consensus of all the sages. It is in this sense Herbert Spensor speaks of God as \"\" Unknown and unknowable.\"\" What he means is that Deity per se is \"\"Unknown and Unknowable.\"\" John Fiasco further argues that \"\"Deity is unknowable to the extent of it is not being manifested to consciousness through the phenomenal world knowable but knowable in order of its phenomenal manifestations: knowable in a symbolic way as the power of being rhythmic life of the universe; knowable as eternal source of moral law.\"\" If we accept this, then Shiv is inconceivable. But if He is not conceived, how can he be worshipped? Yet religious mind craving for eternal happiness cannot be satisfied without worship and cannot do without worship. He, therefore, requires some kind of representation or symbol of God. Without some concrete symbol of God, God would be a formless abstraction devoid of meaning to him/her. Hence it for those, who cannot digest abstract ideas of God, temples are built and images representing Gods in different powers and attributes are consecrated. Whatever may be said against images in the temples, rituals, and ceremonies, the fact remains that they are indispensable at a certain stage of the spiritual evolution life. \\r\\n\\r\\nNirakar Shiv is Amurtha (formless) in his indistinct condition, and is Murtha or Sakar in his manifest condition –manifest in the form of universe. Shiv assumes eight-fold forms and is, therefore, called as Ashtamurthi. Then the Linga represents the whole universe appearing hemispherical placed on something. The Linga, the amorphous symbol of Shiv, thus, represents the Murtha form of Shiv. Hence, the Linga signifies Alinga or Shiv that has no special form or mark. The circular base with round semi-spherical top placed on it fits the description of the idea of Murthavthva.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Linga as Shabdabrahma\\r\\n\\r\\nShivaparabrahman is the cosmic Purusha having Atmavimarsha. He first vibrates in his Leele (play or amusement) towards creation. The vibration is Nada (a loud roar), the first expression as Nama or name. From his Nada proceeds Bindu (dot), i.e. the form. The couplet Nama and Rupa or Nada and Bindu are known as Onkara or Pravana. The Bindu is the disc-like Peetha and Nada is the line that supervenes the Peetha. The line stands on the Bindu like a cylinder with a rounded top. All this forms the Linga.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Linga as the Visvarupa\\r\\n\\r\\nShivaparabrahman has no particular form but is all-formed. He is, therefore, called Visvarupa. He is the creator of the Universe and assumes all forms in the Universe. He is hidden in all creatures, and pervades all and forms inner souls of all. He is said to have a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, and a thousand feet. He has hands and feet in all directions. The semi-spherical top that supervenes the circular base represents this description of cosmic Purusha, with whom His devotees identify Shiv. The round top on the circular base really consists of thousands of heads, each of the size of a point. The sides of the cylindrical figure represents equally thousands of heads, eyes, and faces in all directions. The semi-spherical top, resembling the visible horizon, is truly symbolical of the universe that surrounds the earth on all sides. Though the symbol has no eyes and feet, or eyes and ears, it has thousands of hands and feet, heads, eyes, and ears in all directions, just as a circle has no face all around but it has faces in all directions at every point of the circumference. Thus the Linga is the closest possible representation of such formless or all-formed God Shiv. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is customary in nature that all classes of things in universe must have different shapes and forms. The so-called \"\"Gods class\"\" must have different shapes and forms, though nobody knows what those shapes and forms should be. It is only the fancy of the human beings that has endowed Gods with some anthrophomorphic forms. But there is no proof of that. Nonetheless, it is conceivable that Gods have shapes and forms different from those of human beings as human beings have shapes and forms different from those of other animals,',\n",

I agree that it is problematic to harmonize all of the elements, but the next paragraph focuses on the right wing stuff (i.e., totalitariansm, etc.), and the third paragraph delves into the economics ideology. Neither of those is contradictory to the lead. Fascism arose during a fragmentary, transitional period, and it ideology embraced what today may seem to be contradictory elements. It\\'s probably better to try and get that across earlywhich the reference to \"\"national syndicalism\"\" should facilitate, than oversimplify.\\r\\nRegarding the deleted material, I think there are some claims made there that would have to be sourced and attributed or based on a substantial body of text in the main article that provided context (and sourcing). It should be borne in mind that the WWII-era fascist states of Italy and Germany along with the then quasi-fascist Japan formed the \"\"axis\"\", for example, so the claim of xenophobia seems somewhat specious to me, though ethnocentrism sounds plausible. Just because it sounds plausible, however, does not mean that there are RS describing it as such. Militarism is a common thread, but how does monumental architecture relate to that?

       " '\":The norm for British & American dials is that the correct number of pulses is generated as the dial returns to rest, its speed being controlled by the built-in governor in order to sent the pulses at the correct rate (normally 10 pulses per second).  There is a natural delay introduced between the last pulse (or only pulse in the case of the digit \"\"1\"\") being sent and dial reaching its natural position, then an aditional delay before any further can be sent by the user turning the dial clockwise for the next digit.   So the inter-digit pause is comprise of BOTH the last part of the return movement of the dial and the time taken to \"\"wind it up\"\" ready for the next digit.  In fact in many types of P.O. dial mechanism there was also a slight additional pause immediately upon releasing the dial and before the first pulse was sent, due to the design of the mechanism.  In the SxS switches which predominated in the British network, the inter-digit pause had to be long enough to (a) cause the relays in the current stage to recognize that the dialing of the particular digit had finished, and (b) to allow sufficient time for that stage to find a vacant circuit to the next and for that stage to prepare itself ready to receive the next digit.  31.185.230.165  \\r\\n\\r\\n\"',\n",

What about this, \"\"He became a celebrated hero in Britain among most of the people connected to the British Raj,[3] but unpopular with most Members of Parliament[4]\"\"\\r\\nMy reason for suggesting this is that 247 MPs voted to forcibly retire Dyer from duty with only 37 MPs voting to keep him.  Later, a Dyer supporter (Carson) attempted to pass a motion of mild approval of Dyer, but was defeated 230 MPs (against approval), 129 MPs (pro-mild approval).  This suggests that a majority of MPs was against Dyer.  All this is covered in the reference 4.  Please let me know what you think, I think adding what I suggest above would balance the introduction, yet keep it short.   \"',\n",

       " '\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDear Michael, thanks for your comment. I made the comment about the old version of the article almost exactly 3 years ago, see the version at that time: . It said \"\"Einstein–Cartan theory in theoretical physics extends general relativity, to handle spin angular momentum correctly.\"\" at the very beginning and the whole article was written in the spirit of the claim that general relativity (without extensions) describes the spin incorrectly. As far as I can read, this is no longer claimed by the article. Einstein-Cartan theory is a historically important extension of general relativity, with some extra fields (torsion), but all the modern evidence indicates that such extra fields don\\'t exist - and they\\'re not needed. If you care about sociology, no research of cosmology or calculations of NASA\\'s experiments or anything of the sort takes the \"\"torsion field\"\" into account because the latter doesn\\'t exist, as far as the existing evidence - theoretical or experimental - can say. Today, it\\'s not an important proposal to extend GR. The new article doesn\\'t make these points too clear but at least it also no longer makes crazy claims throughout the text that general relativity (without torsion) is inconsistent with the spin, or something like that, so I wouldn\\'t protest against the new version. Visually, it surely looks like a well-written article. However, I see some confusion in your comment that does show that the articles doesn\\'t explain the basic points too clearly. Einstein-Cartan theory is not \"\"just\"\" about the tetrads. Tetrads are indeed useful - and in some formal sense necessary - to describe spin in General Relativity. However, using the tetrads formalism is not yet Einstein-Cartan theory. Einstein-Cartan theory assumes that \"\"torsion\"\" may be nonzero - even though it is identically zero in general relativity (which normally uses the metric). One can write GR in terms of tetrads as well - and the torsion is still zero. If that\\'s so, one isn\\'t doing Einstein-Cartan theory.   \"',\n",

       " '\"\\r\\n\\r\\n Coup not Revolution \\r\\n\\r\\nFirst off, I removed the reference to \"\"after Yanukovich fled the country\"\".  The term \"\"fled\"\" is loaded and POV.  To say he \"\"left\"\" the country is non-POV... but the statement added zero value in the first place.  Second, let\\'s talk about some English language usage for all the Ukrainians on here, specifically the difference between literal and figurative language:\\r\\n\\r\\nRevolution:  \"\"A fundamental change in power or organizational structures that takes place in a relatively short period of time.\"\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCoup:  \"\"The sudden and illegal seizure of a government, usually instigated by a small group of the existing state establishment to depose the established government and replace it with a new ruling body, civil or military.\"\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me explain the difference clearly.  A revolution occurs when forces abolish government power structures.  This clearly did not occur.  A coup occurs when one faction of the government seizes control of the existing power structures.  This clearly did occur.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no revolution in Ukraine.  There was only a coup.  This position is non-POV and sustainable.  I recommend:  \"\"Maidan Coup\"\" or \"\"2014 Ukrainian Coup\"\"... but the term \"\"Ukrainian Revolution\"\" is both POV and misleading.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote:  Above I use the literal definition of \\'Revolution\\' to mean the violent overthrow of government power structures (e.g. the American Revolution).  Revolution also has a figurative definition of \\'wide-ranging change\\' (e.g. the \\'industrial revolution\\').\\r\\n\\r\\n  Applying a figurative term that is not literally true is necessarily POV.  For example, neither the \"\"Velvet Revolution\"\" nor the \"\"Orange Revolution\"\" were literal revolutions and their names are POV and misleading.  In both cases these monikers were coined by dissidents.  I recognize that these are the terms that are widely used to refer to these events and, having become widely recognized, are appropriate titles in Wikipedia.  That does not change the fact that they are POV.  Nor does it change the fact that, in this case, there is no widely recognized name for these events that would justify such POV naming.  I reiterate that the appropriate title is \"\"Maidan Coup\"\" or \"\"2014 Ukrainian Coup\"\"  173.79.251.253  \"',\n",

According to the Venezuelan Government Press Office, Proarepa is a private company that has \"\"joined this mission (Mission Mercal) to offer food and better price to the Venezuelan consumer\"\".[22] According to El Nuevo Herald, Antonini Wilson\\'s name is linked to other companies in southern Florida, such as Venuz Supply Inc., Intertel Telecom and Techmilk Inc.;[22][25][26] La Nación says that Antonini is among a group of businessmen who benefited economically during the administration of Hugo Chávez.[26] In May of 2007, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) confiscated a jet belonging to American Food Grain. The report, according to The Miami Herald, says Ricardo Fernández Barruecos had not respected federal norms to register the plane in the United States.[22][23][27]\"\"\\r\\nThe mention of Antonini owning the condo with Abad will stay, since there is a link there.\\r\\nWhat are your thoughts on that?\\r\\nBR,\\r\\n  04:42, 18\"',\n",

I just mean that if they don’t know (or just pretend that don’t know) that Lucifugum is one of the most known East European black metal bands and give them just a half of a sentence of 3 pages they don’t look terribly competent in this subject. Just in this subject, I don’t talk about their whole competence. Don’t you agree?  As for the album a year on own label: Lucifugum is a self-releasing band just last 5 years (of 15 years existence). And it doesn’t make them less notable than they were in past. In interviews they explained their decision to make self-releases. It’s just because of a disappointment in labels which didn’t keep their word and promises (but NOT because of lack of interest to the band). “Vector 33” (the first album of  female fronted Lucifugum) was planned to be released on Drakkar prod., but  Drakkar didn’t release it in due time. That’s why Lucifugum have canceled the deal with Drakkar and released “Vector 33” cd by themselves. It was the first Propaganda cd release. Also in Lucifugum interviews I read that they don’t exclude the cooperation with labels in future if they find a noble label with honest principles. By the way, “Stigma Egoism” on Drakkar prod. is not a re-release, this is the first (and last at the moment) cd edition of this album (Propaganda released just tape version). Also Lucifugum released in 2003 two albums on BlackMetal.Com on cd format (a big independent American label with many releases and good financial might). I mean a critery for musicans, Lucifugum released 3 albums on big indie labels.    \\r\\nP.S. They record an album a year (or almost a year) not just now, in early times they did the same things.

       " '\":::Even during the 1891 census, castes like Vilakkithalavan and Veluthedan were counted separately. 90% of the Nairs counted in 1891 belonged to the Kshatriya divisions. The remaining 10% were caste groups wrongly claiming the Nair status. Moreover, the 1891 census in Kerala was conducted by Iyer Brahmins, who had a deep seated resentment towards Nairs (Iyers were treated much below Illathu Nair and Swaroopathil Nair in Travancore caste system and they were not allowed to perform priestly functions). Since all the original castes composing the Nair supergroup were Kshatriya and none of the historians considered the primary occupation of Nairs anything other than being soldiers, there is no reason to change the introductory phrase. As pointed out in the reference, the Nairs were commonly referred as Kshatriyas (whether it is accurate or not is another question) by historians. KN Panikker, probably the most famous historian from Kerala, calls them \"\"a Dravidian variety of the Aryan Kshatriyas\"\". Chintaman Vinayak Vaidya calls them \"\"Nagara Kshatriyas\"\" in his book  Downfall of Hindu India. The question is not whether the much researched Nagvanshi origin is accurate or not. It is whether Nairs were known as Kshatriya during the last millenium. And the answer is yes, from multiple sources. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever the caste system is the most complex in India, and this is the reason why Swami Vivekananda called Kerala a mental assylum. In Kerala, the son of a King can never be a Kshatriya, as according to Nambuthiri beliefs, a Kshatriya should have a Brahmin father and Kshatriya mother. This is the reason why the so called four \"\"Suryavanshi\"\" dynasties of Kerala always married off their females to Nambuthiris. These clans were known as Samanta Kshatriya and were regarded as equivalent to Kshatriya by the Nambuthiris. It should be noted that the Nambuthiris considered every other caste as Sudra, even the other Brahmin communities. The pollution time period (pula) gives an indication to this. Nambuthiris observed 10 days of pula (6 days in some places). The caste which is immediate next to them, the Samanta Kshatriyas observed 11 days of pula. Top most ranked Ambalavasi Brahmin communities like Elayathu and Moosad (unlike other Ambalavasi Brahmins like Maarar, these two castes were recognized by the Nambuthiris as a part of Brahmin community) observed 12 days of pula. This means that the position of Samanta Kshatriya was intermediate between Nambuthiri Brahmin and Ambalavasi Brahmin. The next higher ranking ones were some insignificant divisions of local Brahmins like Pushpaka Brahmins, who observed a pula ranging from 13 to 15 days. Higher ranking Chandravanshi and Nagvanshi Nair groups (all of the Samantans, most of the Kiryathils and most of Illathils) observed a pula of 15 days. Lower ranking Nairs (like Swaroopathil and Charna Nair) observed a pula of 16 days, so did Iyers and lower ranking Ambalavasis like Maarars in Trivandrum (In Palghat Iyers never observed any pula traditions and were independent on their own). \\r\\n\\r\\nRegarding the claim that people were granted the Nair title, I don\\'t think a sufficiently large number of people belonging to other castes were granted the Nair title. A few occurrences are there in Travancore, where during the 18th century a very small number of Iyers were granted the Illath Nair status. During the 18th and 19th century a small number of Vellala and Maravar people were granted Nair status. Other than that there has been absolutely no \"\"conversion of caste\"\". The Portuguese record an incident, during 16th century when a Portuguese captain asked the Cochin King to elevate the status of some lower castes to Nair, the King told him that even the highest ranking Emperor does not have that power. During the end of 19th century, however as the Nair dominance was on a steep decline, a number of servant castes asked the Iyer census takers to count them as Nair, which they happily obeyed. And for a brief period, some of them even added \"\"Nair\"\" or \"\"Pillai\"\" to their surname, until the Kerala government nullified affirmative action benefits to all those who are having such a surname. These groups came not only from the Sudra division, but also from other divisions. These groups included Brahmins like Maarars, GSBs and Pisharodys (In Travancore, where Ambalavasis are having a lower status), Vaishyas like Chettys (in Travancore) and Arya Vaishyas (in Malabar) and even other Kshatriya communities like Marathas and Bunts.   \\r\\n\\r\\n\"',\n",

At times the subject seems to have been suppressed by the science establishment either purposefully or just out of hubris, and anyone discussing the subject publicly ridiculed.  Either way it\\'s \"\"flat-earth society\"\" type behaviour that I find objectionable.\\r\\n\\r\\nI understand your points but disagree, particularly on the notability aspect.  I can easily find scores of entries regarding subjects of less notability than The Resonance Project on Wikipedia.  I am suspicious of the motivation to so quickly suppress my expression of free speech in this so called \"\"community\"\".  Instead of offering a chance for me to bring my article into compliance with Wikipedia standards you quickly deleted it, and by doing so silenced my opinions.  Thats wrong.  And although a comment made by another editor stated that I had a chance to contest the \"\"Speedy Deletion\"\" I could find no such option.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you have notability thresholds for a supposedly public community which rely on mainstream media to set the bar, and the mainstream media is owned and virtually controlled by a few select individuals and organizations with their own agendas, then you have a problem.  Wikipedia you have a problem, and if I can\\'t get entries for \"\"Nassim Haramein\"\" and \"\"The Resonance Project\"\" in I am going to begin a campaign to discredit and inform of the corruption of Wikipedia, the not-so-\"\"free\"\" encyclopedia. Wake up  Wikipedia editors...open your eyes and minds and be a force for good in the world, not another puppet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis new field of spiritual science or Unified Physics, whatever you want to call it, is an important subject and needs to be represented in the sphere of social consciousness whether you agree with it or not.  There are thriving social media communities of 300,000+ individuals on both The Resonance Project and Hassim Harramein\\'s Facebook pages, and yet Wikipedia via it\\'s ignorant (sorry it\\'s true) editors quickly dismiss as not notable.  It\\'s notable enough for 300,000 people to include the information provided by Nassim Haramein and The Resonance Project in their social media feeds, who are you to dismiss so many people\\'s opinions?  300,000 people think about that.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I gather the neccessary information would you be willing to help me organize it in such a manner as to pass muster of the Wikipedia editorial drones?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"',\n",

       " '\"\\r\\n\\r\\n Fairness and neutrality of admins - your recourse \\r\\n\\r\\nHi Nancy,\\r\\n\\r\\nI think it\\'s a difficult question regarding whether admins have treated you fairly or not.  I think you are not wholly innocent but I\\'m not convinced that you have been treated with an even hand either.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs you may know, I was surprised at and somewhat nonplussed that you and Xandar were blocked.  Heck, the whole straw poll/IAR/block incident is questionable in my book.  However, it all happened so quickly and during a period when I was less active at Wikipedia so I chose not to raise a ruckus about it as it seemed to be a fait accompli by the time I learned about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI gather you were rather strident at WP:ANI which is what triggered your block.  This all seems to be \"\"water under the bridge\"\" by now so, rather than reopen old wounds, I would counsel that you learn from the experience and tone down your emotions even if you are being treated unfairly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat said, it\\'s clear to me that there has been a bit of admin myopia seeing incivility on your part while ignoring the same or worse on the part of other editors such as PManderson and others.  I have remarked on this a number of times at Talk:Catholic Church but did not act on it at the time because I was an involved admin.  (I\\'m not an admin anymore so I couldn\\'t act on it now if I wanted to.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAs much as I think the current Catholic Church RFC over versions is ill-advised and likely to be inconclusive, it is now underway so I think we should let it run its course.  Once it\\'s done, you might wish to consider a user conduct RFC to raise the fairness issues.  Note that user conduct RFCs are required to be restricted to one specific user.  Thus, you may wish to raise user conduct RFCs on different users such as UberCryxic, PManderson and even SlimVirgin.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m not saying that such user conduct RFCs will get you the satisfaction that you seem to wish.  However, I\\'m just pointing out what recourse you have if you choose to go down that road.  I reserve the right to decide my response to any such RFCs based upon the facts presented at the time.  (How\\'s that for being a weasel?  Sorry.)\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there seems to be a consensus that you were treated unfairly, the results of the user RFC could be brought up in various forums such as WP:ANI or WP:ARBCOM.  Based on the history to date, however, you should take into account the fact that it is not a clear-cut case of unfair treatment so the user conduct RFCs could get quite contentious.  You have to decide for yourself whether or not issuing them would be worth it.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"',\n",

The claim \"\"The meetings would have a great influence on the shaping of the modern country of Canada as well as on the Pacific Northwest of the United States\"\" appears in the beginning with a now invalid citation link, which isn\\'t terribly surprising given it was listed in 2006. The issue is the cited material does not back the quoted claim in any fashion and nor does any historical narrative I have read. The diplomatic wrangling between the Americans and British for a few decades was over the Columbia River as a border (or not). Eventually the British agreed to an American proposal for the continuation of the border along 49th the parallel.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere does the PGO fit into this? It stated the 54\\'40 was the northern border despite having no control over any land north of the Columbia River. In 1845 an agreement with the local Hudson\\'s Bay Company was established, with the company \"\"joining\"\" the government. Theoretical control was extended by the PGO, but the majority of the offices for the northern districts were held by the British. I don\\'t see this event holding \"\"great influence\"\" over both Canada and the United States. About the only matter that the PGO was to create that influenced (only America) was the Cayuse War.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo what should be done about this exactly? The claim is simply far too bold to be considered historically accurate. In the meantime I updated the link, but it is worth repeating it doesn\\'t validate the claim.   \"',\n",

It was said \"\"Will be archived: If you ever want to return, Jimbo can discuss this message (and your ADMINISTRATORS comment below) from his talk-page archives.\"\" I don\\'t even know what that means. Here is my reply to the person that said that. And then the thing that was archived. The longer article was deleted off the page I put it on. I will glance back at my talk page to see if you have anything to say on this matter. If not I understand that it is not your issue. I would though prefer if you looked at it since that was my point, that people in power beneath you seem to want to bite the newbie to the point that the newbie is leaving and not coming back. They even suggested that my issue was with the WP:3RR rule which was not the issue. As a newbie I didn\\'t know about that, and learned my lesson. It was with the time on the talk page being attacked by a WP:GANG / WP:TAGTEAM which are supported by administrators. So the person who archived my comments of your talk page didn\\'t even get the point. Once I was told of the WP:3RR rule I never even touched the article again. Anyway hopefully you will actually read this before someone else finds a WP:XXXX rule as an excuse to delete it. 86.93.139.223  \\r\\n\\r\\nSo you understand, I had 3 days of a block to read the many WP:XXXX that were thrown at me, to then understand them.

Actually I didn\\'t have to read many, just the ones that were used against me to have me blocked. As I found, they were being totally misquoted against me. So yeah, you might find it hard to believe, you might also want to go to the Alkaline Diet article and look at how many people said exactly the same thing as I did in the past on the article. Is that hard to believe? Don\\'t bother answering, just know that you might want to look at the history and deal with it. I don\\'t understand why this was taken off Jimbo Wales\\' page by someone other than him with a note hard to believe. Isn\\'t that his choice? Yes I would like him to discuss it with me. As I put it on his page with the express comment that the people (like you) who are in between him and me are the problem. So you making a personal judgement that someone can\\'t read a few Wiki WP:XXXX rules in 3 days gives you the right to ignore my very detailed comments. Sorry but this is exactly the reason I contacted Jimbo and not you. Maximus. 86.93.139.223 (talk)  86.93.139.223  \\r\\n\\r\\nDear Jimbo, This is a part of a longer post on the Alkaline Diet page called Harry Potter is a Girl. As I am a newbie I don\\'t know how to do links so copied it here. Sorry for taking your space up on your talk page. Also sorry for WP:TLDR. Please delete this if it is of no interest to you. I can\\'t know what is and what is not of interest to you, and following WP:BOLD I am making my statement and you can decide what to do next. I have put it here as I wanted you to know of my experience here at Wikipedia and how after a few days due to repeated WP:BITE I am leaving Wikipedia editing never to return. Because the people between you and me are the problem I thought to go straight to the top. Sometimes the people at the top don\\'t get told what is going on below them. Anyway thanks for Wikipedia. Good luck and perhaps reduce the number of rules / guidelines as I think they are being manipulated and misused.

Then Ben Stiller arrived 10 minutes after the commentary started and then started arguing with the director Rawson Marshall Thurber and even burping sometimes. After about 25 minutes Thurber becomes very annoyed with the stupidity of Ben Stiller and leaves the studio. Then both Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn did anything besides commenting the film, with Vaughn even threatening the crew at the studio. After about 40 minutes from the beginning of the commentary a woman comes in the studio and tells Ben that if he doesn't move his car it will be towed. After this both Stiller and Vaughn leave the studio with almost an hour left in the film! The two men of the studio crew then, in total embarassment, put on the commentary of There's Something about Mary. This proves the complete unprofessionality of Vaughn and Stiller. They behaved awfully, Stiller, after 5 minutes of his arrival wanted to leave and Vaughn insulted one of the studio crew members and, after Thurber went away they began criticizing him.
